mtg-price
=========

Node.js experiment to display Magic cards + pricing info

ideas:
- scrape daily for avg prices
- autocomplete + comparison

things to do once i have internet:
- scrape edh generals
- try timestamp'd files

eliahs notes
- autocard
- gens and lands both link to buy
- small land pictures, with columns
- leave top area, general should match inputted one
